Project: Crop Recommendation System

Project Description:
This project is about recommendation of crop based on provided environmental status or used materials like NPK,
temperature, humidity, rainfall and any others factors that plats important role in harvesting the good crop for better productivity.

Project's Workflow:

1. Data collection
2. Data preparation & processing
3. Choosing best model
4. Evaluation
5. UI part

6. Data Collection:
   --> The data is collected from Kaggle learning site.

7. Data preparation & processing:
   --> The data is already fine-tuned and not takes more time to describe it as well as manipulate for better processing.

8. Choosing best model:
   --> The data is fitte with lots of machine learing model like kneighbors, randomforestclassifier, svm,decisiontreeclassifier and others model. And, all the model gives their best accuracy. But, among them RandomForestClassifier is selected as best model with accuracy score 0.9931818181818182 .

9. Evaluation:
   --> When the selecte model undergoes for the evaluation process then it evaluates or recommend the best crop for cultivation based on the input provided by the user.

10. UI part:
    --> The overall front part is made as simple as possible for easier of user. In this, there are no sp much styling. My aim is to make it very simple with fully integrated with less style so that, the user can easily use it.
